# references

What is a references? A reference is like a name. A name tells you which thing I'm talking about, but it isn't the thing itself. If I say, "Suzy is an excellent computer programmer," then you know who I'm talking about, because I used Suzy's name. References in BackTalk work the same way. A reference looks like this:

    $suzy

or this

    $my_best_friend

or any other bunch of letters and underscores, as long as it starts with a `$`.


    {simple_example}

    $suzy

Try switching `$suzy` for `$harry` or `$bingo` in the example above
