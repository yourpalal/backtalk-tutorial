# What is BackTalk?

BackTalk is a scripting language: it turns words into actions that are performed by a piece of software. BackTalk is designed to let you talk
back to the software you use. This way, you can enhance and customise it,
or maybe even turn it into something completely new! BackTalk is designed
to be easy to read and write, even if you have never programmed before. There are still a few concepts you will need to learn before becoming
a proficient BackTalker, but the learning curve is short and hopefully
easy.

# When Can You Use BackTalk?

Because BackTalk lets you take control of a software application, you can only use it when it is already built in to the software you want to control. This pairing might seem like an inconvenience, but it allows the
BackTalk scripts you write to be as specific as possible. This way, you can get the software working the way you want with less effort.

# Why Use BackTalk?

There are a few reasons why you may want to use BackTalk. One discussed above, is to enhance the software you already use. This isn't the only way you might use it, however. BackTalk could also be used to build small interactive applications from scratch by using a piece of software designed with this goal in mind. Some of the uses that we hope BackTalk could be good for include:

 * customising software you use to make it work better for you
 * sharing scripts with friends to extend well-used software
 * (simple) videogame modding
 * making interactive art
 * making simple applications to meet your needs not met by existing software
 * learning the basics of computer programming in a helpful, fun environment
