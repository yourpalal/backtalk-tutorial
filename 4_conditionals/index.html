<p>Sometimes, you want to check on something before deciding what to do. BackTalk can help you do this! There is a command called <code>if:</code> that lets you test something, and then run a command if the test passes.</p>
<p>That could look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>if:
    in case (it is raining) then:
        take the umbrella
        put on a jacket

    in case (it is sunny) then:
        put on sunglasses

    otherwise:
        put on layers
</code></pre><p>In this example, if it&#39;s raining, we will take an umbrella, and put on a jacket. If it&#39;s sunny, we will put on sunglasses. If it&#39;s raining and sunny, then we will take the umbrella and put on a jacket, but won&#39;t put on sunglasses. <code>if:</code> only does the first <code>in case $ then:</code> that it can. <code>if:</code> also provides an
<code>otherwise:</code> command which will be run only if no cases match. In the example above, we use <code>otherwise:</code> to layer up in unrecognized weather.</p>
<p>You can play with <code>if:</code> in the example below. Try adding an <code>otherwise:</code> in where you can!</p>
<pre><code>-- ConditionalExample

if:
    in case ($bingo is hungry) then:
        feed $bingo

    in case ($harry is hungry) then:
        feed $harry

    in case ($suzy is hungry) then:
        feed $suzy

    otherwise:
        print &quot;no hungry friends!&quot;

if:
    in case ($suzy is bored) then:
        give $suzy a video game

    in case ($harry is bored) then:
        give $harry a book
</code></pre><p><code>if:</code> can even be used to calculate a value. We could change the
first <code>if:</code> statement in the example above to use <code>with $ as:</code> like so:</p>
<pre><code>-- ConditionalExample

with $hungry_friend as:
    if:
        in case ($bingo is hungry) then:
            $bingo
        in case ($harry is hungry) then:
            $harry
        in case ($suzy is hungry) then:
            $suzy

if:
    in case $hungry_friend then:
        feed $hungry_friend
    otherwise:
        print &quot;no hungry friends!&quot;
</code></pre><p>Notice that <code>$hungry_friend</code> is set to the result of the <code>if:</code> command, which is determined by which friend is hungry. If no
friend is hungry, then <code>$hungry_friend</code> will not refer to anything,
meaning the command body of <code>in case $hungry_friend then:</code> will not be run.</p>
<p>You may also have noticed that we are only feeding one of our friends. This works well for the examples, because it lets
us explore conditional commands, but it&#39;s not very nice. Could you
modify the example above to feed each friend, but only when they&#39;re
hungry?</p>
